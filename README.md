# 🖼️ JS Interactive Image Gallery with Popup & Keyboard Navigation

This is a **responsive, fully interactive image gallery** built from scratch using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks, no libraries, no nonsense.

Users can click on thumbnails to open a full-size image in a popup modal, and navigate through the images using **keyboard controls**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Click-to-preview popup functionality
- ✅ Navigate with:
  - `ArrowRight` → next image
  - `ArrowLeft` → previous image
  - `Escape` → close popup
- ✅ Clean, modular JavaScript logic
- ✅ Responsive layout using Flexbox and `vw`-based scaling
- ✅ No external libraries or dependencies — just pure code

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – semantic markup
- **CSS3** – Flexbox, styling, responsiveness
- **JavaScript** – DOM manipulation and event handling
- **Visual Studio Code** – development environment
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and hosting

## 🧠 About the Project

This project was created as part of my learning journey through JavaScript DOM manipulation and UI/UX thinking.  
I intentionally avoided using external libraries like Lightbox or jQuery to challenge myself and build everything manually.

It’s a great showcase of:
- Keyboard navigation logic
- Gallery image indexing
- Dynamic content updates
- Reusable and readable code
